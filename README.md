### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Santiago

I'm independent machine learning engineer and university professor with more than 13 years of experience teaching engineering subjects in the fields of mathematics and programming.

I have a bachelor's degree in Information Systems Engineering (Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional - Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·), and a master degree in Complex Systems Engineering (UniversitÃ© de technologie de Troyes - France). Since machine learning is my passion, I did a specialization offered by Google Cloud Training and other in Natural Language Processing (NLP) offered by deeplearning.ia

I'm interested in developing my professional career in machine learning applying my acquired knowledge and experience at implementing systems with a positive impact on our society.
