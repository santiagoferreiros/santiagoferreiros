#### Hi there 👋, I am Santiago 😊

I'm independent machine learning engineer and university professor with more than 13 years of experience teaching engineering subjects in the fields of mathematics and programming. I'm interested in developing my professional career in machine learning applying my acquired knowledge and experience at implementing systems with a positive impact on our society.

#### Currently:

- 👨‍💻 Working on Computer Vision using StyleGAN and Pix2Pix models.
- 👨‍🎓 Learning Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN's).  
- 👨‍🏫 Teaching Maths and Programming at University (UTN - FRBA).
- 👨‍🔬 Researching in Signal Processing using entropy and complexity measures.
- 🕵️‍♂️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science and Machine Learning projects.


#### Machine Learning projects:

- Student feedback sentiment analysis using logistic regression.
- Automatic book summarization with probabilistic models.
- Recommendation system to support learning process using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor).
- Predict cannabis consumption level according to personality.
- Classification of cardiac arrhythmias using CNN (convolutional Neural Networks).
